        <h2>Unemployment and Homelessness in the United States</h2>
        <p>Source: AP News — "Home prices are out of reach for many Americans. See how much income you need to buy one."
        </p>
        <p>Summary: This article highlights how housing costs have surged in the U.S., with the average home now
            requiring an income far above the national median. The housing crisis contributes to growing financial
            insecurity and homelessness. Many Americans are unable to buy or even rent homes due to stagnant wages,
            inflation, and a lack of affordable housing. This economic instability exacerbates the challenges of finding
            stable employment, especially for young adults, single-income households, and marginalized communities.</p>
        <p>
            Relevance to Project: This source supports the foundation for my capstone project by showing that access to
            secure housing is no longer guaranteed for many people, especially when employment is unstable. The lack of peaceful living(anju) in the modern world contrasts sharply with the utopia imagined in the Peach Blossom Spring.

        <h2>Barriers to Employment in the U.S.</h2>
        <p>Source: Federal Reserve — "Worker Voices: Barriers to Employment"</p>
        <p>Summary: This special research brief reports on qualitative interviews with people who face challenges getting or keeping jobs. Barriers include criminal history, lack of transportation, child care responsibilities, unstable housing, and systemic discrimination. Many participants expressed a desire to work but encountered invisible systems that prevent long-term stability and independence.</p>
        <p>Relevance to Project: The findings connect to the broader concept of (Leye) — finding joy or purpose in work. InThe Peach Blossom Spring, villagers work in harmony without competition or fear of survival. This research reveals how far modern systems are from that ideal and provides contrast for my interactive utopia.</p>

        <h2>Peach Blossom Spring (桃花源记)and Utopian Ideals</h2>
        <p>Summary: This scholarly paper explores the literary, philosophical, and cultural significance of Yuanming Tao’s the Peach Blossom Spring. It interprets the fable as a political and spiritual response to the chaos of the late Eastern Jin period, envisioning a society free of war, hierarchy, and material struggle. The story has since become a symbolic framework for imagining alternative, peaceful futures.
        </p>
        <p>Relevance to Project: This source is foundational for my design theme. It provides a deep understanding of how the Peach Blossom Spring functions as both a critique and an aspiration. By comparing it with modern issues like unemployment and housing insecurity, I can highlight the values of finding joy or purpose in work and living peaceful explore how they might be visualized in an interactive speculative future.</p>
