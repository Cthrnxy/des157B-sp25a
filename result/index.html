    <h1>Usability Test Results</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Three Significant Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users appreciated the peaceful aesthetic and narrative tone but didn't immediately grasp the
                future-oriented theme without additional explanation.</li>
            <li>The clickable elements (NPCs, CTA buttons, dialog close buttons) were not visually distinct, causing
                confusion about what actions were available.</li>
            <li>In both mini-game scenes, users struggled to identify the interactive zones, especially due to low
                contrast or elements blending into the background.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>How the Project Can Be Improved</h2>
        <h3>Main Scene:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a white border or glow around clickable NPCs to indicate interactivity.</li>
            <li>Redesign CTA buttons and dialog close (“X”) buttons to stand out more clearly with higher contrast or
                icon styling.</li>
            <li>Improve visual cues (e.g. hover state, slight movement) to guide user actions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Women's Game Scene:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Brighten the background to visually separate clickable elements from the scene.</li>
            <li>Add subtle animation (e.g. pulsing or color shift) to indicate clickable objects.</li>
            <li>Ensure instructions are more clearly labeled so users understand the goal of the interaction.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Elderly Game Scene:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Increase contrast between background and buttons to make interaction areas more visible.</li>
            <li>Highlight draggable elements with borders or shadows.</li>
            <li>Consider using a tooltip or label to guide first-time users.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Narrative Clarity:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Make the theme of “imagining the future” more explicit in the intro scene or dialogue.</li>
            <li>Add a short written intro or visual cue that helps contextualize the user’s actions as building a future.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Can Users Figure Out How to Navigate/Interact with Your Project?</h2>
        <p>Yes — after revisions, clearer instructions and highlighted interactive elements were added to help users understand how to navigate the scene and interact with characters, games, and dialogue elements.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Does the Project Impact the User the Way You Want It To?</h2>
        <p>The project mostly impacts users as intended. It evokes reflection and curiosity, but the future-oriented message needs to be more clearly signposted for full emotional resonance.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>What Modifications Need to Be Made to Interactions, Visuals, or Other Elements to Make It Stronger?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Strengthen visual hierarchy for buttons and dialog boxes.</li>
            <li>Improve contrast and add hover/animation cues to draw attention to interactive zones.</li>
            <li>Reinforce narrative context by adjusting the pacing and placement of thematic text.</li>
            <li>Animate final scene feedback to create a more engaging and satisfying conclusion.</li>

        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Plan of How You Will Update Your Capstone Project Based on the Feedback</h2>
        <p>Please refer to the section "How the Project Can Be Improved" above. I will systematically address each issue in the main scene, mini-games, and final sequence, focusing on visual clarity, interaction design, and narrative delivery to strengthen the user experience.
