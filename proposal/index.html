        <h1>Journey to Peach Blossom Spring: An Interactive Web Utopia</h1>
    <section>
        <p>I want to create an interactive website inspired by Tao Yuanming's Peach Blossom Spring which is a Chinese fable in 421 CE, describing an utopia village retreat from society. The users explore a tranquil digital world in narrative, NPC interaction, and creative expression. This project encourages people on themes of harmony with the Han dynasty. Allowing users to learn what is the utopia concept in Chinese and create a printing for that time and make the conversation with the character.
        </p>

        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>This project reimagines the ancient Chinese utopia of Peach Blossom Spring as an interactive game composed of three narrative frames. The final frame, “The Hidden Village,” is a creative sandbox where users interact with villagers (NPCs) and use a drawing tool to personalize the world.
        </p>
        <p>The journey reflects on escapism, self-discovery, and the search for peace in a chaotic world — mirroring modern desires for simplicity, fairness, and balance.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Frame 1: The Wandering Traveler</h3>
                <p> The user meets an old fisherman who hints at a hidden land. Players choose dialogue paths that influence how they enter the utopia.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Frame 2: The Blossom Tunnel</h3>
                <p>A mysterious and magical environment. Users solve a simple interactive riddle or task to continue the journey.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Frame 3: The Hidden Village (main frame)</h3>
                <p> The user meets villagers (NPCs) who ask philosophical questions drawn from the original text's themes. The player can then draw and decorate the village using a p5.js-powered drawing tool — leaving a visual mark on the utopia.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <i></i><h2>Design & Visual Style</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Aesthetic inspired by Chinese ink painting and watercolor landscapes</li>
            <li>Traditional fonts and soft, natural colors</li>
            <li>Dialogue presented in next dialogue boxes</li>
            <li>Calm, meditative sound effects (e.g., flowing water, wind, guqin)</li>
            <li>The target audience are young adults and students experiencing burnout or societal pressure. people interested in Eastern philosophy and cultural storytelling.</li>
            <li>Imagining what a modern version of a secluded utopia might look and feel like in digital space. Questioning the modern idea that productivity and success are always tied to visibility, speed, and achievement. Creating a peaceful, imagined world as a counterpoint to modern dystopias. Allowing the user to draw and decorate the space gives them agency in shaping their own utopia.</li>
