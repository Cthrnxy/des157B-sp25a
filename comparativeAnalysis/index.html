        <h2>Animal Crossing</h2>
        <img src="images/animal.png" alt="animal">
        <p>Animal Crossing is a life simulation game developed by Nintendo, where players move to a peaceful island and live alongside anthropomorphic animal villagers (NPCs). With no fixed objectives, players are free to decorate their homes, engage in conversations, participate in seasonal events, and enjoy activities like fishing, gardening, and bug catching. The game's open-ended design and soothing atmosphere make it a beloved example of an idealized, digital utopia centered on creativity, community, and slow living.</p>
        <p>In Animal Crossing, the player often engages in conversations with characters, which is a common storytelling method in game design. These dialogues with non-player characters (NPCs) not only build the narrative but also guide the player through subtle hints and calls to action. For my project, the core interaction is centered around the player talking to NPCs. Through these conversations, the story unfolds and the player learns how to take interactive actions within the world.

        <h2>FFF.cmiscm</h2>
        <img src="images/FFF.gif" alt="fff">
        <p>FFF.cmiscm is a well-known interactive web project created by Korean designer Jongmin Kim. The website serves as an interactive archive, where each entry explores different visual elements and unique interaction methods. Through playful and experimental design, the site transforms everyday scenes into engaging digital experiences, highlighting the creative potential of web-based interaction.</p>
        <p>It is helpful for my project. I can inspire a certain kind of interaction from it. I think about the player custom of a village to create an utopia. Let the player plant some trees or build some houses etc. I am planning to use the draggable jQuery or p5 library. </p>
